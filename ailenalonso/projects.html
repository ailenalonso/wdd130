                <p>In my projects as an interior designer, I look for the client to feel comfortable and at ease with their choices, when starting with this design I understood their needs, they wanted to achieve an open space that includes the kitchen, dining room, and living room, on a functional and practical way in a reduced space. The main objective was to achieve a good separation of each sector with elements and furniture, so that the change from one sector to another can be noticed, still being an open space.</p>

                <p>In this project, the client was looking to re-design the living room, although the space was reduced, we wanted to achieve an environment that meets the required functionality. The main objective of this project was to achieve a space that provides warmth, which could be achieved by taking the design to warm colors, and wood, and installing a fireplace.</p>

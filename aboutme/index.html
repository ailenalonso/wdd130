    <h4> <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ailen and I'm from Argentina, I live here with my husband and my little son.</p> <p>I'm an Interior Designer but I was looking for a change in my career, and that's why I started PathwayConnect. I've just finished it the past semester and discovered how much I love programming, before choosing my certificate in Web and Computer Programming in my last semester on Pathway I didn't really have a lot of knowledge about the IT world, but I have to say that I always was interested in it.</p><p> This semester I'm looking forward to learning more and developing new skills.</p></h4>
